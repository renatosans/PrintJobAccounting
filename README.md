# PrintJobAccounting
Contabiliza trabalhos de impressão e cópias

This service looks for printer jobs when they are created in the printer spool.
This is done by monitoring the spool directory using .NET  FileSystemWatcher

You can use the web interface to generate reports based on the print logs.

Its included an alternative solution using PAPERCUT, where the print logs are generated by PAPERCUT and imported into SQL Server using C#
This tool logs are in the format:
        //     daily         Ex.:  papercut-print-log-2022-09-19.csv
        //     montlhy       Ex.:  papercut-print-log-2022-09.csv
        //     all-time      Ex.:  papercut-print-log-all-time.csv

The web interface provides an Endpoint to register client Printers,  printers are discovered using SNMP and page counters are sent to the backend so that reports can be generated using printer info.

SNMP discovery service (printer and network equipment) depends on a external C# library  ->   SharpSnmpLib

Possible update to this NPM package ->   https://www.npmjs.com/package/net-snmp,   using   PM2  to keek service runing after restarts.
